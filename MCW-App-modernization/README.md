# App modernization

Contoso, Ltd. (Contoso) is a new company in an old business. Founded in Auckland, NZ, in 2011, they provide a full range of long-term insurance services to help individuals who are under-insured, filling a void their founders saw in the market. From the beginning, they grew faster than anticipated and have struggled to cope with rapid growth. During their first year alone, they added over 100 new employees to keep up with the demand for their services. To manage policies and associated documentation, they use a custom-developed Windows Forms application, called PolicyConnect. PolicyConnect uses an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database as its data store, along with a file server on its local area network for storing policy documents. That application and its underlying processes for managing policies have become increasingly overloaded.

Contoso recently started new web and mobile projects to allow policyholders, brokers, and employees to access policy information without requiring a VPN connection into the Contoso network. The web project is a new .NET Core 2.2 MVC web application, which accesses the PolicyConnect database using REST APIs. They eventually intend to share the REST APIs across all their applications, including the mobile app and WinForms version of PolicyConnect. They have a prototype of the web application running on-premises and are interested in taking their modernization efforts a step further by hosting the app in the cloud. However, they don't know how to take advantage of all the managed services of the cloud since they have no experience with it. They would like some direction converting what they have created so far into a more cloud-native application.

They have not started the development of a mobile app yet. Contoso is looking for guidance on how to take a .NET developer-friendly approach to implement the PolicyConnect mobile app on Android and iOS.

To prepare for hosting their applications in the cloud, they would like to migrate their SQL Server database to a PaaS SQL service in Azure. Contoso is hoping to take advantage of the advanced security features available in a fully-managed SQL service in the Azure. By migrating to the cloud, they hope to improve their technological capabilities and take advantage of enhancements and services that are enabled by moving to the cloud. The new features they would like to add are automated document forwarding from brokers, secure access for brokers, access to policy information, and reliable policy retrieval for a dispersed workforce. They have been clear that they will continue using the PolicyConnect WinForms application on-premises, but want to update the application to use cloud-based APIs and services. Additionally, they want to store policy documents in cloud storage for retrieval via the web and mobile apps.

## Target audience

- Application developer

## Abstracts

In this whiteboard design session, you work with a group to design a solution for modernizing legacy on-premises applications and infrastructure by leveraging cloud services. As part of the modernization effort, application enhancements are added using a mix of web and mobile services, all secured using Azure Active Directory.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, your ability to design a modernization plan for organizations looking to move services from on-premises to the cloud will be improved.
